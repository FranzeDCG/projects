The E-manual for anyone trying to mod pacbob!
To mod everything as it should be modded, carefully do the steps noted below.

Steps:
1. Open the Minecraft Launcher and create a new installation
 1.1 Set the installation to the current pacsnap, e.g. 1.21.4
 1.2 Name it anything you want and leave the rest the same
2. Open Process Explorer (files\devtools\apps\Process Explorer\procexp64.exe)
 2.1 In Process Explorer, scroll and search for "Minecraft.exe"
 2.2 Underneath "Minecraft.exe", search for "javaw" and click on it's properties
 2.3 Copy the command line in the "javaw" properties
3. Open any text editor
 3.1 Paste the line into the text editor (Minecraft and Process Explorer are allowed to close now)
 3.2 Change "--demo" at the end of the line with "--minecraft"
 3.3 Search for "--username" and replace "Player" (next to "--username") with "%muser%"
 3.4 Replace the new chunk of lines with the old one in "x86\files\pacbob! Minecraft Launcher.bat"
 3.5 Press "Ctrl+S" to save the modded pacbob! Launcher.

Now if all above is finished, go back to the x86 folder, and run "pacbob! Minecraft Launcher".
Make sure there aren't any other Minecraft windows opened, if there are, close them before you run pacbob!.
